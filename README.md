# parallelization-of-sequence-alignment
The aim of this project is to compare serial and parallel implementations of Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment on randomly generated nucleotide sequences, to analyse the efficiency between the methods when overhead and size of inputs are increased exponentially, and also to obtain the detected sequence represented in the output of this programme.
